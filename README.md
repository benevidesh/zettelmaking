# Zettelmaking

A set of scripts to assist you in creating ["a partner in communication"](http://luhmann.surge.sh/communicating-with-slip-boxes)

## What counts as a note?

Any markdown file (`.md`) with a yaml heading.

```md
---
title: Communicating with Slip Boxes
id: 202212161604 
type:
keywords: []
---
```

To be precise, only the `title:` entry is mandatory.
The `id` is automatically generated by the `zn` script
